## <a name='WhyVite'></a>Why Vite?

Vite is a tool for developing web applications. It works by creating a **"development" version** of your project and provides a server for previewing and testing that version. In this "development" mode you can quickly iterate on the project and see the application **"hot reload"** without having to restart the server. 

When it is time to **deploy** your project, it provides tools for **"compiling"** the project into a **"production" version** of the project that can easily be deployed on a third-party hosting service. For basic front-end only applications, we'll use **Github Pages**. Eventually we'll use a more robust hosting service like Render which can provide a full back-end server and a database server.

Vite can be used for both simple and complex projects, from front-end only applications that use nothing but Vanilla JS to robust full-stack applications using frameworks like React.

Sure, you could build a project from scratch where the "development" version and the "production" version are one-and-the-same. But tools like Vite provide many benefits which you'll learn to appreciate with time and experience.

## <a name='Setup'></a>Setup 

First, create a Github repository and clone it down.

Inside the repo, create a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) project called `app` using the `npm create vite` command:

```sh
npm create vite
# > Project Name: app
# > Select a framework: Vanilla
# > Select a variant: JavaScript
```

This will create a folder in your repo called `app`. This is your **development** version of the application.

Then `cd` into the directory and install Vite dependencies and other dependencies for the project:

```sh
cd app
npm i
npm i uuid
```

Clean up the directory by removing some of the provided code. Delete the `counter.js` and `javascript.svg` files and move the `main.js` and `style.css` files into a `src` directory.

```sh
rm counter.js javascript.svg
mkdir src
mv main.js src/
mv style.css src/
```

Edit the provided starter code:
* Empty out the `main.js` file keeping the `import './style.css'` line.
* Empty out the `style.css` file, keeping the styles you want to keep (I like to keep `:root`, `body`, `h1`, and `#app` styles).
* Edit the `<script>` tag `index.html` (line 11) so that it references `src/main.js`.

To test that everything works, add some code to your `main.js` file...

```js
console.log("hello world");
document.querySelector("#app").innerHTML += '<h1>Hello world</h1>';
```

...and then run the Vite development server from the terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should be able to preview the application at http://localhost:5173/

Once you've confirmed everything is connected, go ahead and **commit and push**.

## <a name='PlanningOutTheData'></a>Planning Out The Data

To start this project, I want to keep things simple. I want each of my todos to be an object with at minimum a unique id, a title, and a Boolean for marking the todo as complete or not. So something like this:

```js
{
  uuid: "5affd4e4-418d-4b62-beeb-1c0f7aaff753",
  title: "take out the trash",
  isComplete: false
}
```

It is often helpful to create some example data that can be shown to the user when the application first loads. So I'll create a `todos.json` file in the `src/` directory with an Array of these objects that can be loaded by the application:

```json
[
  {
    "uuid": "5affd4e4-418d-4b62-beeb-1c0f7aaff753",
    "title": "Take out the trash",
    "isComplete": false
  },
  {
    "uuid": "32521ef4-d64c-4906-b06d-f3d0d6b16e0f",
    "title": "Wash the dishes",
    "isComplete": false
  },
  {
    "uuid": "8b144d62-faa7-4226-87e1-096d7c1bedc7",
    "title": "Pay rent",
    "isComplete": true
  }
]
```

Loading this data is easy! In `main.js`, just add:

```js
import initialTodos from './todos.json';
```

The variable name `initialTodos` can be whatever you want.

A little bit of code let's us see this data on the page:

```js
import initialTodos from './todos.json';

initialTodos.forEach((todo) => {
  document.querySelector('#app').innerHTML += `<li>${todo.title}</li>`;
});
```

## <a name='LocalStorage'></a>Local Storage

The `todos.json` file will just be the "seed" for our application's data. If we want to create, update, or delete todos, we'll use the user's [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/setItem).

`localStorage` is a built-in API (you don't need to import anything) for storing data in the user's browser's memory. When data is stored in `localStorage`, it will stay there, even if the page is reloaded or the tab is closed. 

There are two primary functions to use when dealing with `localStorage`:
1. `localStorage.setItem('key', value)`
2. `localStorage.getItem('key')`

```js
const person = { name: "Alex" };
localStorage.setItem("user", person);
console.log(localStorage.getItem("user")); // "[object Object]"; not useful!
```

Note: **`localStorage` only supports storing strings** so, in the example above, the `person` Object is turned into a string before being stored. When we retrieve it, it is still a string.

To properly store and retrieve Objects/Arrays, we should **stringify** and **parse** the values.

```js
const person = { name: "Alex" };
localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(person));
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"))); // { name: "Alex" }
```

So, to help us deal with this easily, we can create these handy helper functions:

```js
// sets a new key-value pair in local storage.
const setLocalStorageKey = (key, value) => localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));

// tries to get a value from local storage.
const getLocalStorageKey = (key) => {
  try {
    return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return null;
  }
}

const names = ['alice', 'bryan', 'charlotte'];
setLocalStorageKey('names', names);
console.log(getLocalStorageKey('names')); // ['alice', 'bryan', 'charlotte']
```

## <a name='CreatingaDataLayerforCRUD'></a>Creating a Data Layer for CRUD

To keep things organized, I'll create a separate file called `data-layer-utils.js` with the following functions:

```js
import initialTodos from './todos.json';

//////////////////////////////////
// Generic localStorage Helpers //
//////////////////////////////////

// sets a new key-value pair in local storage.
const setLocalStorageKey = (key, value) => {
  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
};

// tries to get a value from local storage.
const getLocalStorageKey = (key) => {
  try {
    return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return null;
  }
}

///////////////////////
// Todo List Helpers //
///////////////////////

// sets the todos Array in localStorage with the key 'todos'
export const setTodos = (todos) => {}
// returns the Array of all todo Objects from localStorage
export const getAllTodos = () => {} 
// adds a new todo Object to the Array of todos in localStorage
export const addTodo = (todo) => { } 
// finds a todo by uuid and replaces it with the given todo in localStorage
export const updateTodo = (uuid, todo) => { } 
// finds a todo by uuid and removes it from the Array of todos
export const deleteTodo = (uuid) => { } 
// stores todos from the todos.json file in localStorage, but only if localStorage doesn't have them already
export const initializeTodosIfEmpty = () => {}
```

Once I complete these functions, I'll import them into `main.js` and test them out:

```js
import './style.css';
import { getAllTodos, initializeTodosIfEmpty, addTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo } from './data-layer-utils';

const main = () => {
  initializeTodosIfEmpty();
  console.log(getAllTodos());
  addTodo({ uuid: 1, name: 'ben' });
  console.log(getAllTodos());
  updateTodo(1, { name: 'liz' });
  console.log(getAllTodos());
  deleteTodo(1);
  console.log(getAllTodos());
}

main();
```

Once I've confirmed that I can get all todos, create a new todo, update the todo, and delete it, I'll **commit and push** my progress.

> üöÄ **Complete Code:** see the complete [`data-layer-utils.js` file here](./app/src/data-layer-utils.js)

## <a name='RenderingAllTodos'></a>Rendering All Todos

Now that I can manage the todos using `localStorage`, I can start building out the UI.

1. I'll start by rendering the initial set of default todos. 
2. Then, I'll add functionality for updating a todo (marking it as complete / incomplete)
3. Then, I'll add functionality for deleting a todo
4. Finally, I'll add a form for adding new todos

When rendering the todos, I want them to be in a list and each have this HTML structure:

```html
<li data-uuid="5affd4e4-418d-4b62-beeb-1c0f7aaff753" class="todo-card">
  <h3>Take out the trash</h3>
  <div>
    <label>
      Complete
      <input type="checkbox" name="isComplete" checked="">
    </label>
    <button class="delete-todo">üóëÔ∏è</button>
  </div>
</li>
```

Note how the `li` element has the `uuid` value of the todo as a `data-uuid` attribute! This will come in handy later when we want to delete / update specific todo items.

To achieve this in an organized fashion, in `main.js` I'll create two new functions:

```js
import { getAllTodos, initializeTodosIfEmpty, addTodo, toggleTodoComplete, deleteTodo } from './data-layer-utils';

const renderTodoCard = (todo) => {
  // creates a new li with the structure above and appends it to the ul
}

const renderTodos = () => {
  const todos = getAllTodos();
  todos.forEach((todo) => renderTodoCard(todo));
}

const main = () => {
  initializeTodos();
  renderTodos();
}
```

Use `npm run dev` to preview the application, using the Chrome Developer Console to debug.

At this point, you should see the todos displayed with the structure above and you can take some time to style them.

## <a name='Whatsnext'></a>What's next?

Okay! So our application can show todos fetched from `localStorage`. You can choose to implement each of the remaining features in whatever order you choose. 

I'm going to work on creating todos next. That way, when I implement updating and deleting later, I can add new todos and then delete / update them afterwards without having to reset the `localStorage` to get the default todos back.

> üí° **tip**: You can reset `localStorage` with `localStorage.clear()`

## <a name='CreatingNewTodos'></a>Creating New Todos

To make the simplest todo, we just need a form with a single text input for the title of the todo. 

```html
<form id="new-todo-form" aria-label="new-todo-form">
  <div class="label-input-container">
    <label for="todo-title">Title</label>
    <input type="text" name="todoTitle" id="todo-title" required />
  </div>
  <button>Add</button>
</form>
```

We can have new todos start as incomplete and we'll provide a `uuid`. Again, our todos should be Objects that look like this:

```js
{
  uuid: "5affd4e4-418d-4b62-beeb-1c0f7aaff753",
  title: "take out the trash",
  isComplete: false
}
```

We'll create these objects each time the form is submitted. We'll use the `addTodo` helper function we made in the `data-layer.utils.js` file:

```js
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
import { getAllTodos, initializeTodosIfEmpty, addTodo, toggleTodoComplete, deleteTodo } from './data-layer-utils';

const renderTodoCard = (todo) => { /* ... */ };
const renderTodos = () => { /* ... */ };

const handleNewTodo = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  const form = e.target;
  const newTodo = {
    uuid: uuidv4(),
    title: form.todoTitle.value,
    isComplete: false
  }
  addTodo(newTodo);
  renderTodos();

  form.reset();
};

const main = () => {
  initializeTodosIfEmpty();
  renderTodos();

  document.querySelector("form#new-todo-form").addEventListener('submit', handleNewTodo);
};
```

Remember to re-render the todos using your `renderTodos` helper function after adding the new todo!

## <a name='DeletingandUpdatingTodos'></a>Deleting and Updating Todos

To handle deleting and updating todos, we want to detect `input` change events on the checkboxes and `click` events on the delete buttons inside of each `li.todo-card`.

To avoid creating a new event listener on each `li.todo-card`, we'll take advantage of propagation and create two delegation event handlers on the `ul#todos-list`, one for updating and one for deleting.

```js
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
import { getAllTodos, initializeTodosIfEmpty, addTodo, toggleTodoComplete, deleteTodo } from './data-layer-utils';

const renderTodoCard = (todo) => { /* ... */ };
const renderTodos = () => { /* ... */ };

const handleNewTodo = (e) => { /* ... */ };

// a delegation event handler for the checkbox inputs
const handleTodoChange = (e) => { /* ... */ }

// a delegation event handler for the delete buttons
const handleDeleteTodo = (e) => { /* ... */ };

const main = () => {
  initializeTodosIfEmpty();
  renderTodos();
  document.querySelector("form#new-todo-form").addEventListener('submit', handleNewTodo);

  // put the event handlers on the ul, not on the individual li elements.
  document.querySelector("ul#todos-list").addEventListener('input', handleTodoChange);
  document.querySelector("ul#todos-list").addEventListener('click', handleDeleteTodo);
};
```

This is where having the `uuid` as a data attribute on each todo `li` comes in handy! Whenever a checkbox or button is clicked, we can check the `li` parent element and get the `dataset.uuid` value from it. Then, we can easily feed it to our data layer helper functions before re-rendering.

## <a name='ConfigureViteforDeploymentonGithubPages'></a>Configure Vite for Deployment on Github Pages

And that's it!!

Do some final testing and styling on the development server and then we get get this thing published!

Before we can publish the Github pages, we want to make the **production version** of the application. Before we do that, we'll need to configure Vite to create that version where we want it to.

Create a Vite configuration file

```sh
touch vite.config.js
```

And put this inside:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  // GitHub Pages expects an index.html in the root directory
  // so just run npm build before pushing to GitHub and this will rebuild our assets to the root
  build: { outDir: '..' },
  // needed for github pages just put the repo name here
  // For example, my repo is located at https://github.com/benspector-mls/f23-2-3-0-todo-app-example
  // so I put:
  // base: '/f23-2-3-0-todo-app-example/'
  base: '/your-repo-name-here/', 
});
```

Now, run the command

```sh
npm run build
```

This will **compile** the code you've written in your `app/` folder into ordinary and "minified" static files that can easily be served by Github pages. It will put those files in the root directory of your repo, where Github expects to find an `index.html` file and any associated assets.

You can see what this "deployed" version will look like by running the command...

```sh
npm run preview
```

...which will serve the application at http://localhost:4173/

Finally, **commit and push** your new compiled version to Github!

## <a name='PublishonGithubPages'></a>Publish on Github Pages

Publishing your application on Github Pages is about as easy as it gets.

1. Open the repo on Github.com
2. Go to the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab
3. Find the <kbd>Pages</kbd> section
4. Make sure that **Source** is **Deploy from a branch**
5. Below, set **Branch** to `main` (or whatever branch you're using)
6. Click **Save** and wait a few minutes! You should see the URL of your application.
7. Each time you push a new commit to `main`, your page will redeploy!
